# PEC_performance_prediction
These are the analytical data and code sets used in the paper titled "Prediction of Photoelectrochemical Performance of Hematite Electrodes by Analytical Data"

There are two folders, which were used for the analysis using 28 data with PEIS data, and for those using 75 data without PEIS data. 
They correspond to the 1st and 2nd section of the paper. In each folder, analytical data obtained by analytical methods are stored
in the same folder. The codes are stored in the folder "code." The general procedure is; 1. import the data, 2. extraction of 
features, 3. feature selection and the following prediction.
